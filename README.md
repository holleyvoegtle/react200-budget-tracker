# React/Redux Budget Tracker

The purpose of this project was to create a React application using Redux. The application that was created was a budget tracker that takes in expenses and income and returns a real time assemsent of your budget. React has a mechanism for managing state, but it's most effective for contolling state at the component level. Though it can be used to manage state for the whole application, inter-component state can be very difficult to manange. This is where Redux comes in. Redux is a library for managing the state of your application. This idea is that all data is kept in the Store. Any component can get data it needs this way. Reducters and Actions are also included. This is a strict one-way data flow. 

The app can be viewed/played with on [Heroku](https://hvbudgetcalc.herokuapp.com/)
